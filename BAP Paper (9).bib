  abstract = {The last decade has witnessed an experimental revolution in data science and machine learning, epitomised by deep learning methods. Indeed, many high-dimensional learning tasks previously thought to be beyond reach -- such as computer vision, playing Go, or protein folding -- are in fact feasible with appropriate computational scale. Remarkably, the essence of deep learning is built from two simple algorithmic principles: first, the notion of representation or feature learning, whereby adapted, often hierarchical, features capture the appropriate notion of regularity for each task, and second, learning by local gradient-descent type methods, typically implemented as backpropagation. While learning generic functions in high dimensions is a cursed estimation problem, most tasks of interest are not generic, and come with essential pre-defined regularities arising from the underlying low-dimensionality and structure of the physical world. This text is concerned with exposing these regularities through unified geometric principles that can be applied throughout a wide spectrum of applications. Such a 'geometric unification' endeavour, in the spirit of Felix Klein's Erlangen Program, serves a dual purpose: on one hand, it provides a common mathematical framework to study the most successful neural network architectures, such as {CNNs}, {RNNs}, {GNNs}, and Transformers. On the other hand, it gives a constructive procedure to incorporate prior physical knowledge into neural architectures and provide principled way to build future architectures yet to be invented.}

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence has the potential to open insight into the structure of proteins at the scale of evolution. It has only recently been possible to extend protein structure prediction to two hundred million cataloged proteins. Characterizing the structures of the exponentially growing billions of protein sequences revealed by large scale gene se-quencing experiments would necessitate a breakthrough in the speed of folding. Here we show that direct inference of structure from primary sequence using a large language model enables an order of magnitude speed-up in high resolution structure prediction. Leveraging the insight that language models learn evolutionary patterns across millions of sequences, we train models up to 15B parameters, the largest language model of proteins to date. As the language models are scaled they learn information that enables prediction of the three-dimensional structure of a protein at the resolution of individual atoms. This results in prediction that is up to 60x faster than state-of-the-art while maintaining resolution and accuracy. Building on this, we present the {ESM} Metage-nomic Atlas. This is the first large-scale structural characterization of metagenomic proteins, with more than 617 million structures. The atlas reveals more than 225 million high confidence predictions , including millions whose structures are novel in comparison with experimentally determined structures, giving an unprecedented view into the vast breadth and diversity of the structures of some of the least understood proteins on earth.}

  abstract = {Over the past few years, many machine learning-based scoring functions for predicting the binding of small molecules to proteins have been developed. Their objective is to approximate the distribution which takes two molecules as input and outputs the energy of their interaction. Only a scoring function that accounts for the interatomic interactions involved in binding can accurately predict binding affinity on unseen molecules. However, many scoring functions make predictions based on data set biases rather than an understanding of the physics of binding. These scoring functions perform well when tested on similar targets to those in the training set but fail to generalize to dissimilar targets. To test what a machine learning-based scoring function has learned, input attribution, a technique for learning which features are important to a model when making a prediction on a particular data point, can be applied. If a model successfully learns something beyond data set biases, attribution should give insight into the important binding interactions that are taking place. We built a machine learning-based scoring function that aimed to avoid the influence of bias via thorough train and test data set filtering and show that it achieves comparable performance on the Comparative Assessment of Scoring Functions, 2016 ({CASF}-2016) benchmark to other leading methods. We then use the {CASF}-2016 test set to perform attribution and find that the bonds identified as important by {PointVS}, unlike those extracted from other scoring functions, have a high correlation with those found by a distance-based interaction profiler. We then show that attribution can be used to extract important binding pharmacophores from a given protein target when supplied with a number of bound structures. We use this information to perform fragment elaboration and see improvements in docking scores compared to using structural information from a traditional, data-based approach. This not only provides definitive proof that the scoring function has learned to identify some important binding interactions but also constitutes the first deep learning-based method for extracting structural information from a target for molecule design.},

In {GAT}, every node attends to its neighbors given its own representation as the query. However, in this paper we show that {GAT} computes a very limited kind of attention: the ranking of the attention scores is unconditioned on the query node. We formally define this restricted kind of attention as static attention and distinguish it from a strictly more expressive dynamic attention. Because {GATs} use a static attention mechanism, there are simple graph problems that {GAT} cannot express: in a controlled problem, we show that static attention hinders {GAT} from even fitting the training data. To remove this limitation, we introduce a simple fix by modifying the order of operations and propose {GATv}2: a dynamic graph attention variant that is strictly more expressive than {GAT}. We perform an extensive evaluation and show that {GATv}2 outperforms {GAT} across 11 {OGB} and other benchmarks while we match their parametric costs.

  abstract = {Accurate prediction of protein–ligand binding affinity is important for lowering the overall cost of drug discovery in structure-based drug design. For accurate predictions, many classical scoring functions and machine learning-based methods have been developed. However, these techniques tend to have limitations, mainly resulting from a lack of sufficient energy terms to describe the complex interactions between proteins and ligands. Recent deep-learning techniques can potentially solve this problem. However, the search for more efficient and appropriate deep-learning architectures and methods to represent protein–ligand complex is ongoing. In this study, we proposed a deep-neural network model to improve the prediction accuracy of protein–ligand complex binding affinity. The proposed model has two important features, descriptor embeddings with information on the local structures of a protein–ligand complex and an attention mechanism to highlight important descriptors for binding affinity prediction. The proposed model performed better than existing binding affinity prediction models on most benchmark datasets. We confirmed that an attention mechanism can capture the binding sites in a protein–ligand complex to improve prediction performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/Blue1993/{BAPA}.},

  abstract = {Graph Neural Networks ({GNNs}) have recently gained in popularity, challenging molecular fingerprints or {SMILES}-based representations as the predominant way to represent molecules for binding affinity prediction. Although simple ligand-based graphs alone are already useful for affinity prediction, better performance on multi-target datasets has been achieved with models that incorporate 3D structural information. Most recent advances utilize complex {GNN} architectures to capture 3D protein-ligand information by incorporating ligand-interacting protein atoms as additional nodes in the graphs; or by building a second protein-based graph in parallel. This expands the graph considerably while obfuscating the shape of the underlying ligand, diminishing the advantage that {GNNs} have when encoding molecular structures. There is therefore a need for a simple and elegant molecular graph representation that retains the topology of the ligand while simultaneously encoding 3D protein-ligand interactions. We present Protein-Ligand Interaction Graphs ({PLIGs}): a simple way of representing atom-atom contacts of 3D protein-ligand complexes as node features for {GNNs}. {PLIGs} featurize an atom node in the molecular graph by describing each atom’s properties as well as all atom-atom contacts made with protein atoms within a distance threshold. The edges of the graph are therefore identical to ligand-based graphs, but the nodes encode the 3D protein-ligand contacts. Since {PLIGs} are applicable to any {GNN} architecture, we have benchmarked their performance with six different {GNN} architectures, and compared them to conventional ligand-based graphs and fingerprint-based multi-layer perceptron ({MLP}) models using the {CASF}-2016 benchmark set where we found {PLIG}-based Graph Attention Networks ({GATNet}) to be the best performing model (ρ=0.84, {RMSE}=1.22 {pK}). In summary, we created a novel graph-based representation that incorporates 3D structural information into the node features of ligand-shaped molecular graphs. The {PLIG} representation is simple, elegant, flexible and easily customizable, opening up many possibilities of incorporating other 2D and 3D properties into the graph. The code and implementation for {PLIGs} and all models can be found at github.com/{MarcMoesser}/Protein-Ligand-Interaction-Graphs.},

Despite the recent advances in the application of deep convolutional and graph neural network-based approaches, it remains unclear what the relative advantages of each approach are and how they compare with physics-based methodologies that have found more mainstream success in virtual screening pipelines. We present fusion models that combine features and inference from complementary representations to improve binding affinity prediction. This, to our knowledge, is the first comprehensive study that uses a common series of evaluations to directly compare the performance of three-dimensional (3D)-convolutional neural networks (3D-{CNNs}), spatial graph neural networks ({SG}-{CNNs}), and their fusion. We use temporal and structure-based splits to assess performance on novel protein targets. To test the practical applicability of our models, we examine their performance in cases that assume that the crystal structure is not available. In these cases, binding free energies are predicted using docking pose coordinates as the inputs to each model. In addition, we compare these deep learning approaches to predictions based on docking scores and molecular mechanic/generalized Born surface area ({MM}/{GBSA}) calculations. Our results show that the fusion models make more accurate predictions than their constituent neural network models as well as docking scoring and {MM}/{GBSA} rescoring, with the benefit of greater computational efficiency than the {MM}/{GBSA} method.

However, the memory usage and computation cost of these voxel-based approaches increase cubically with respect to spatial resolution and sometimes make volumetric {CNNs} intractable at higher resolutions. Therefore, it is necessary to develop memory-efficient alternatives that can accelerate the convolutional operation on 3D volumetric representations of the protein-ligand interaction. In this study, we implement a novel volumetric representation, {OctSurf}, to characterize the 3D molecular surface of protein binding pockets and bound ligands. The {OctSurf} surface representation is built based on the octree data structure, which has been widely used in computer graphics to efficiently represent and store 3D object data. Vanilla 3D-{CNN} approaches often divide the 3D space of objects into equal-sized voxels. In contrast, {OctSurf} recursively partitions the 3D space containing the protein-ligand pocket into eight subspaces called octants. Only those octants containing van der Waals surface points of protein or ligand atoms undergo the recursive subdivision process until they reach the predefined octree depth, whereas unoccupied octants are kept intact to reduce the memory cost. Resulting non-empty leaf octants approximate molecular surfaces of the protein pocket and bound ligands. These surface octants, along with their chemical and geometric features, are used as the input to 3D-{CNNs}. Two kinds of {CNN} architectures, {VGG} and {ResNet}, are applied to the {OctSurf} representation to predict binding affinity. The {OctSurf} representation consumes much less memory than the conventional voxel representation at the same resolution. By restricting the convolution operation to only octants of the smallest size, our method also alleviates the overall computational overhead of {CNN}. A series of experiments are performed to demonstrate the disk storage and computational efficiency of the proposed learning method. Our code is available at the following {GitHub} repository: https://github.uconn.edu/mldrugdiscovery/{OctSurf}.},

Binding affinity helps in understanding the degree of protein-ligand interactions and is a useful measure in drug design. Protein-ligand docking using virtual screening and molecular dynamic simulations are required to predict the binding affinity of a ligand to its cognate receptor. Performing such analyses to cover the entire chemical space of small molecules requires intense computational power. Recent developments using deep learning have enabled us to make sense of massive amounts of complex data sets where the ability of the model to “learn” intrinsic patterns in a complex plane of data is the strength of the approach. Here, we have incorporated convolutional neural networks to find spatial relationships among data to help us predict affinity of binding of proteins in whole superfamilies toward a diverse set of ligands without the need of a docked pose or complex as user input. The models were trained and validated using a stringent methodology for feature extraction. Our model performs better in comparison to some existing methods used widely and is suitable for predictions on high-resolution protein crystal (⩽2.5 Å) and nonpeptide ligand as individual inputs. Our approach to network construction and training on protein-ligand data set prepared in-house has yielded significant insights.

  abstract = {Drug discovery often relies on the successful prediction of protein-ligand binding affinity. Recent advances have shown great promise in applying graph neural networks ({GNNs}) for better affinity prediction by learning the representations of protein-ligand complexes. However, existing solutions usually treat protein-ligand complexes as topological graph data, thus the 3D geometry-based biomolecular structural information is not fully utilized. The essential intermolecular interactions with long-range dependencies, including type-wise interactions and molecule-wise interactions, are also neglected in {GNN} models. To this end, we propose a geometry-aware interactive graph neural network ({GIANT}) which consists of two components: 3D geometric graph learning network (3DG-{NET}) and pairwise interactive learning network ({PI}-{NET}). Specifically, 3DG-{NET} iteratively performs the node-edge interaction process to update embeddings of nodes and edges in a unified framework while preserving the 3D geometric factors among atoms, including spatial distance, polar angle and dihedral angle information in 3D space. Moreover, {PI}-{NET} is adopted to incorporate both element type-level and molecule-level interactions. Specially, interactive edges are gathered with a subsequent reconstruction loss to reflect the global type-level interactions. Meanwhile, a pairwise attentive pooling scheme is designed to identify the critical interactive atoms for complex representation learning from a semantic view. An exhaustive experimental study on two benchmarks verifies the superiority of {GIANT}.},

However, data-driven {AI} models unequivocally suffer from a lack of sufficiently large and unbiased datasets. Here, we systematically investigated the data biases on the {PDBbind} and {DUD}-E datasets. We examined the model performance of atomic convolutional neural network ({ACNN}) on the {PDBbind} core set and achieved a Pearson R2 of 0.73 between experimental and predicted binding affinities. Strikingly, the {ACNN} models did not require learning the essential protein-ligand interactions in complex structures and achieved similar performance even on datasets containing only ligand structures or only protein structures, while data splitting based on similarity clustering (protein sequence or ligand scaffold) significantly reduced the model performance. We also identified the property and topology biases in the {DUD}-E dataset which led to the artificially increased enrichment performance of virtual screening. The property bias in {DUD}-E was reduced by enforcing the more stringent ligand property matching rules, while the topology bias still exists due to the use of molecular fingerprint similarity as a decoy selection criterion. Therefore, we believe that sufficiently large and unbiased datasets are desirable for training robust {AI} models to accurately predict protein-ligand interactions.},

Thus, machine learning or deep learning based methods have been developed recently to improve the scoring functions.

  abstract = {Empirical scoring functions based on either molecular force fields or cheminformatics descriptors are widely used, in conjunction with molecular docking, during the early stages of drug discovery to predict potency and binding affinity of a drug-like molecule to a given target. These models require expert-level knowledge of physical chemistry and biology to be encoded as hand-tuned parameters or features rather than allowing the underlying model to select features in a data-driven procedure. Here, we develop a general 3-dimensional spatial convolution operation for learning atomic-level chemical interactions directly from atomic coordinates and demonstrate its application to structure-based bioactivity prediction. The atomic convolutional neural network is trained to predict the experimentally determined binding affinity of a protein-ligand complex by direct calculation of the energy associated with the complex, protein, and ligand given the crystal structure of the binding pose. Non-covalent interactions present in the complex that are absent in the protein-ligand sub-structures are identified and the model learns the interaction strength associated with these features. We test our model by predicting the binding free energy of a subset of protein-ligand complexes found in the {PDBBind} dataset and compare with state-of-the-art cheminformatics and machine learning-based approaches. We find that all methods achieve experimental accuracy and that atomic convolutional networks either outperform or perform competitively with the cheminformatics based methods. Unlike all previous protein-ligand prediction systems, atomic convolutional networks are end-to-end and fully-differentiable. They represent a new data-driven, physics-based deep learning model paradigm that offers a strong foundation for future improvements in structure-based bioactivity prediction.}

  abstract = {In structure-based drug design, scoring functions are used to evaluate protein–ligand interactions. This protocol shows how to use the {CASF}-2013 benchmark to assess scoring functions in terms of their scoring, ranking, docking, and screening power. Scoring functions are a group of computational methods widely applied in structure-based drug design for fast evaluation of protein–ligand interactions. To date, a whole spectrum of scoring functions have been developed based on different assumptions or algorithms. Therefore, it is important to both the end users and the developers of scoring functions that their performance be objectively assessed. We have developed the comparative assessment of scoring functions ({CASF}) benchmark as an open-access solution for scoring function evaluation. The latest {CASF}-2013 benchmark enables evaluation of the so-called 'scoring power', 'ranking power', 'docking power', and 'screening power' of a given scoring function with a high-quality test set of 195 complexes formed between diverse protein molecules and their small-molecule ligands. Evaluation results of the standard scoring functions implemented in several mainstream software programs (including Schrödinger, {MOE}, Discovery Studio, {SYBYL}, and {GOLD}) are provided as reference. This benchmark has become popular among the scoring function community since its first release. In this protocol, we provide detailed descriptions of the data files included in the {CASF}-2013 package and step-by-step instructions on how to conduct the performance tests with the ready-to-use computer scripts included in the package. This protocol is expected to lower the technical hurdles in front of new and existing users of the {CASF}-2013 benchmark. On a standard desktop workstation, it takes roughly half an hour to complete the whole evaluation procedure for one scoring function, once the required inputs, i.e., the results computed on the test set, are ready to use.},

  abstract = {In structure-based drug design, scoring functions are often employed to evaluate protein–ligand interactions. A variety of scoring functions have been developed so far, and thus, some objective benchmarks are desired for assessing their strength and weakness. The comparative assessment of scoring functions ({CASF}) benchmark developed by us provides an answer to this demand. {CASF} is designed as a “scoring benchmark”, where the scoring process is decoupled from the docking process to depict the performance of scoring function more precisely. Here, we describe the latest update of this benchmark, i.e., {CASF}-2016. Each scoring function is still evaluated by four metrics, including “scoring power”, “ranking power”, “docking power”, and “screening power”. Nevertheless, the evaluation methods have been improved considerably in several aspects. A new test set is compiled, which consists of 285 protein–ligand complexes with high-quality crystal structures and reliable binding constants. A panel of 25 scoring functions are tested on {CASF}-2016 as a demonstration. Our results reveal that the performance of current scoring functions is more promising in terms of docking power than scoring, ranking, and screening power. Scoring power is somewhat correlated with ranking power, so are docking power and screening power. The results obtained on {CASF}-2016 may provide valuable guidance for the end users to make smart choices among available scoring functions. Moreover, {CASF} is created as an open-access benchmark so that other researchers can utilize it to test a wider range of scoring functions. The complete {CASF}-2016 benchmark will be released on the {PDBbind}-{CN} web server (http://www.pdbbind-cn.org/casf.asp/) once this article is published.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Accurately predicting the binding affinities of large sets of diverse protein–ligand complexes is an extremely challenging task. The scoring functions that attempt such computational prediction are essential for analysing the outputs of molecular docking, which in turn is an important technique for drug discovery, chemical biology and structural biology. Each scoring function assumes a predetermined theory-inspired functional form for the relationship between the variables that characterize the complex, which also include parameters fitted to experimental or simulation data and its predicted binding affinity. The inherent problem of this rigid approach is that it leads to poor predictivity for those complexes that do not conform to the modelling assumptions. Moreover, resampling strategies, such as cross-validation or bootstrapping, are still not systematically used to guard against the overfitting of calibration data in parameter estimation for scoring functions. Results: We propose a novel scoring function ({RF}-Score) that circumvents the need for problematic modelling assumptions via non-parametric machine learning. In particular, Random Forest was used to implicitly capture binding effects that are hard to model explicitly. {RF}-Score is compared with the state of the art on the demanding {PDBbind} benchmark. Results show that {RF}-Score is a very competitive scoring function. Importantly, {RF}-Score's performance was shown to improve dramatically with training set size and hence the future availability of more high-quality structural and interaction data is expected to lead to improved versions of {RF}-Score.

  abstract = {The drug development process is a major challenge in the pharmaceutical industry since it takes a substantial amount of time and money to move through all the phases of developing of a new drug. One extensively used method to minimize the cost and time for the drug development process is computer-aided drug design ({CADD}). {CADD} allows better focusing on experiments, which can reduce the time and cost involved in researching new drugs. In this context, structure-based virtual screening ({SBVS}) is robust and useful and is one of the most promising in silico techniques for drug design. {SBVS} attempts to predict the best interaction mode between two molecules to form a stable complex, and it uses scoring functions to estimate the force of non-covalent interactions between a ligand and molecular target. Thus, scoring functions are the main reason for the success or failure of {SBVS} software. Many software programs are used to perform {SBVS}, and since they use different algorithms, it is possible to obtain different results from different software using the same input. In the last decade, a new technique of {SBVS} called consensus virtual screening ({CVS}) has been used in some studies to increase the accuracy of {SBVS} and to reduce the false positives obtained in these experiments. An indispensable condition to be able to utilize {SBVS} is the availability of a 3D structure of the target protein. Some virtual databases, such as the Protein Data Bank, have been created to store the 3D structures of molecules. However, sometimes it is not possible to experimentally obtain the 3D structure. In this situation, the homology modeling methodology allows the prediction of the 3D structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence. This review presents an overview of the challenges involved in the use of {CADD} to perform {SBVS}, the areas where {CADD} tools support {SBVS}, a comparison between the most commonly used tools, and the techniques currently used in an attempt to reduce the time and cost in the drug development process. Finally, the final considerations demonstrate the importance of using {SBVS} in the drug development process.},

  abstract = {In understanding biology at the molecular level, analysis of protein interactions and protein binding affinity is a challenge. It is an important problem in computational and structural biology. Experimental measurement of binding affinity in the wet-lab is expensive and time consuming. Therefore, machine learning approaches are widely used to predict protein interactions and binding affinities by learning from specific properties of existing complexes. In this work, we propose an innovative computational model to predict binding affinities and interaction based on sequence, structural and interface features of the interacting proteins that are robust to binding associated conformational changes. We modeled the prediction of binding affinity asclassification and regression problem with least-squared and support vector regression models using structure and sequence features of proteins. Specifically, we have used the number and composition of interacting residues at protein complexes interface as features and sequence features. We evaluated the performance of our prediction models using Affinity Benchmark Dataset version 2.0 which contains a diverse set of both bound and unbound protein complex structures with known binding affinities. We evaluated our regression performance results with root mean square error ({RMSE}) as well as Spearman and Pearson's correlation coefficients using a leave-one-out cross-validation protocol. We evaluate classification results with {AUC}-{ROC} and {AUC}-{PR}. Our results show that Support Vector Regression performs significantly better than other models with a Spearman Correlation coefficient of 0.58, Pearson Correlation score of 0.55 and {RMSE} of 2.41 using 3-mer and sequence feature. It is interesting to note that simple features based on 3-mer features and the properties of the interface of a protein complex are predictive of its binding affinity. These features, together with support vector regression achieve higher accuracy than existing sequence based methods.},

  abstract = {There has been considerable recent progress in designing new proteins using deep-learning methods1–9. Despite this progress, a general deep-learning framework for protein design that enables solution of a wide range of design challenges, including de novo binder design and design of higher-order symmetric architectures, has yet to be described. Diffusion models10,11 have had considerable success in image and language generative modelling but limited success when applied to protein modelling, probably due to the complexity of protein backbone geometry and sequence–structure relationships. Here we show that by fine-tuning the {RoseTTAFold} structure prediction network on protein structure denoising tasks, we obtain a generative model of protein backbones that achieves outstanding performance on unconditional and topology-constrained protein monomer design, protein binder design, symmetric oligomer design, enzyme active site scaffolding and symmetric motif scaffolding for therapeutic and metal-binding protein design. We demonstrate the power and generality of the method, called {RoseTTAFold} diffusion ({RFdiffusion}), by experimentally characterizing the structures and functions of hundreds of designed symmetric assemblies, metal-binding proteins and protein binders. The accuracy of {RFdiffusion} is confirmed by the cryogenic electron microscopy structure of a designed binder in complex with influenza haemagglutinin that is nearly identical to the design model. In a manner analogous to networks that produce images from user-specified inputs, {RFdiffusion} enables the design of diverse functional proteins from simple molecular specifications. Fine-tuning the {RoseTTAFold} structure prediction network on protein structure denoising tasks yields a generative model for protein design that achieves outstanding performance on a wide range of protein structure and function design challenges.},

  abstract = {Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, {AlphaFold}, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction ({CASP}14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of {AlphaFold} is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm. {AlphaFold} predicts protein structures with an accuracy competitive with experimental structures in the majority of cases using a novel deep learning architecture.},

In recent years, many scientists have taken advantage of the remarkable progress of deep learning and applied it to address this issue. Despite all the advances in this field, there is increasing evidence that the typically applied validation of these methods is not suitable for medicinal chemistry applications. This work assesses the importance of dataset quality and proper dataset splitting techniques demonstrated on the example of the {PDBbind} dataset. We also introduce a new tool for the analysis of protein-ligand complexes, called po-sco. Po-sco allows the extraction of interaction information with much higher detail and comprehensibility than the tools available to date. We trained a transformer-based deep learning model to generate protein-ligand interaction fingerprints that can be utilized for downstream predictions, such as binding affinity. When using po-sco, this model generated predictions that were superior to those based on commonly used {PLIP} and {ProLIF} tools. We also demonstrate that the quality of the dataset is more important than the number of data points and that suboptimal dataset splitting can lead to a significant overestimation of model performance.},

With the rise of modern machine‐learning in drug discovery, novel scoring functions using machine‐learning techniques achieved significant performance gains in virtual screening and ligand optimization tasks on retrospective data.

A few studies have been made to discuss the performance of machine-learning-based methods, but the reason for this improvement remains unclear. In this study, by systemically controlling the structural and sequence similarity between the training and test proteins of the {PDBbind} benchmark, we demonstrate that protein structural and sequence similarity makes a significant impact on machine-learning-based methods. After removal of training proteins that are highly similar to the test proteins identified by structure alignment and sequence alignment, machine-learning-based methods trained on the new training sets do not outperform the conventional scoring functions any more. On the contrary, the performance of conventional functions like X-Score is relatively stable no matter what training data are used to fit the weights of its energy terms.},

Graph neural networks ({GNNs}) predict ligand affinity from graph representations of protein–ligand interactions typically extracted from X-ray structures. Despite some promising findings leading to claims that {GNNs} can learn details of protein–ligand interactions, such predictions are also controversially viewed. For example, evidence has been presented that {GNNs} might not learn protein–ligand interactions but memorize ligand and protein training data instead. We have carried out affinity predictions with six {GNN} architectures on community-standard datasets and rationalized the predictions using explainable artificial intelligence. The results confirm a strong influence of ligand—but not protein—memorization during {GNN} learning and also show that some {GNN} architectures increasingly prioritize interaction information for predicting high affinities. Thus, while {GNNs} do not comprehensively account for protein–ligand interactions and physical reality, depending on the model, they balance ligand memorization with learning of interaction patterns. Graph neural networks have proved useful in modelling proteins and their ligand interactions, but it is not clear whether the patterns they identify have biological relevance or whether interactions are merely memorized.

It is well-known that there are many situations where this is a scientifically risky thing to do, even when the assays are against exactly the same target, but the risks of assays being incompatible are even higher when pulling data from large collections of literature data like {ChEMBL}. Here, we estimate the amount of noise present in combined data sets using cases where measurements for the same compound are reported in multiple assays against the same target. This approach shows that {IC}50 assays selected using minimal curation settings have poor agreement with each other: almost 65\% of the points differ by more than 0.3 log units, 27\% differ by more than one log unit, and the correlation between the assays, as measured by Kendall’s τ, is only 0.51. Requiring that most of the assay metadata in {ChEMBL} matches (“maximal curation”) in order to combine two assays improves the situation (48\% of the points differ by more than 0.3 log units, 13\% by more than one log unit, and Kendall’s τ is 0.71) at the expense of having smaller data sets. Surprisingly, our analysis shows similar amounts of noise when combining data from different literature K i assays. We suggest that good scientific practice requires careful curation when combining data sets from different assays and hope that our maximal curation strategy will help to improve the quality of the data that are being used to build and validate {ML} models for bioactivity prediction. To help achieve this, the code and {ChEMBL} queries that we used for the maximal curation approach are available as open-source software in our {GitHub} repository, https://github.com/rinikerlab/overlapping_assays.},

  abstract = {Developing robust methods for evaluating protein–ligand interactions has been a long-standing problem. Data-driven methods may memorize ligand and protein training data rather than learning protein–ligand interactions. Here we show a scoring approach called {EquiScore}, which utilizes a heterogeneous graph neural network to integrate physical prior knowledge and characterize protein–ligand interactions in equivariant geometric space. {EquiScore} is trained based on a new dataset constructed with multiple data augmentation strategies and a stringent redundancy-removal scheme. On two large external test sets, {EquiScore} consistently achieved top-ranking performance compared to 21 other methods. When {EquiScore} is used alongside different docking methods, it can effectively enhance the screening ability of these docking methods. {EquiScore} also showed good performance on the activity-ranking task of a series of structural analogues, indicating its potential to guide lead compound optimization. Finally, we investigated different levels of interpretability of {EquiScore}, which may provide more insights into structure-based drug design. Machine learning can improve scoring methods to evaluate protein–ligand interactions, but achieving good generalization is an outstanding challenge. Cao et al. introduce {EquiScore}, which is based on a graph neural network that integrates physical knowledge and is shown to have robust capabilities when applied to unseen protein targets.},

However, the robust performance and wide applicability of scoring functions remain a big challenge for increasing the success rate of docking-based virtual screening. Herein, a novel scoring function named {RTMScore} was developed by introducing a tailored residue-based graph representation strategy and several graph transformer layers for the learning of protein and ligand representations, followed by a mixture density network to obtain residue–atom distance likelihood potential. Our approach was resolutely validated on the {CASF}-2016 benchmark, and the results indicate that {RTMScore} can outperform almost all of the other state-of-the-art methods in terms of both the docking and screening powers. Further evaluation confirms the robustness of our approach that can not only retain its docking power on cross-docked poses but also achieve improved performance as a rescoring tool in larger-scale virtual screening.},

  abstract = {Unlike other methods for docking ligands to the rigid 3D structure of a known protein receptor, Glide approximates a complete systematic search of the conformational, orientational, and positional space of the docked ligand. In this search, an initial rough positioning and scoring phase that dramatically narrows the search space is followed by torsionally flexible energy optimization on an {OPLS}-{AA} nonbonded potential grid for a few hundred surviving candidate poses. The very best candidates are further refined via a Monte Carlo sampling of pose conformation; in some cases, this is crucial to obtaining an accurate docked pose. Selection of the best docked pose uses a model energy function that combines empirical and force-field-based terms. Docking accuracy is assessed by redocking ligands from 282 cocrystallized {PDB} complexes starting from conformationally optimized ligand geometries that bear no memory of the correctly docked pose. Errors in geometry for the top-ranked pose are less than 1 Å in nearly half of the cases and are greater than 2 Å in only about one-third of them. Comparisons to published data on rms deviations show that Glide is nearly twice as accurate as {GOLD} and more than twice as accurate as {FlexX} for ligands having up to 20 rotatable bonds. Glide is also found to be more accurate than the recently described Surflex method.},

Nevertheless, most machine learning-based scoring functions are only applicable to a specific task, e.g., binding affinity prediction, binding pose prediction or virtual screening, suggesting that the development of a scoring function with balanced performance in all critical tasks remains a grand challenge. To this end, we propose a novel parameterization strategy by introducing an adjustable binding affinity term that represents the correlation between the predicted outcomes and experimental data into the training of mixture density network. The resulting residue-atom distance likelihood potential not only retains the superior docking and screening power over all the other state-of-the-art approaches, but also achieves a remarkable improvement in scoring and ranking performance. We emphatically explore the impacts of several key elements on prediction accuracy as well as the task preference, and demonstrate that the performance of scoring/ranking and docking/screening tasks of a certain model could be well balanced through an appropriate manner. Overall, our study highlights the potential utility of our innovative parameterization strategy as well as the resulting scoring framework in future structure-based drug design.},

A large number of molecular representations exist, and there are several methods (similarity and distance metrics) to quantify the similarity of molecular representations. In this work, eight well-known similarity/distance metrics are compared on a large dataset of molecular fingerprints with sum of ranking differences ({SRD}) and {ANOVA} analysis. The effects of molecular size, selection methods and data pretreatment methods on the outcome of the comparison are also assessed. A supplier database (https://mcule.com/) was used as the source of compounds for the similarity calculations in this study. A large number of datasets, each consisting of one hundred compounds, were compiled, molecular fingerprints were generated and similarity values between a randomly chosen reference compound and the rest were calculated for each dataset. Similarity metrics were compared based on their ranking of the compounds within one experiment (one dataset) using sum of ranking differences ({SRD}), while the results of the entire set of experiments were summarized on box and whisker plots. Finally, the effects of various factors (data pretreatment, molecule size, selection method) were evaluated with analysis of variance ({ANOVA}). This study complements previous efforts to examine and rank various metrics for molecular similarity calculations. Here, however, an entirely general approach was taken to neglect any a priori knowledge on the compounds involved, as well as any bias introduced by examining only one or a few specific scenarios. The Tanimoto index, Dice index, Cosine coefficient and Soergel distance were identified to be the best (and in some sense equivalent) metrics for similarity calculations, i.e. these metrics could produce the rankings closest to the composite (average) ranking of the eight metrics. The similarity metrics derived from Euclidean and Manhattan distances are not recommended on their own, although their variability and diversity from other similarity metrics might be advantageous in certain cases (e.g. for data fusion). Conclusions are also drawn regarding the effects of molecule size, selection method and data pretreatment on the ranking behavior of the studied metrics.

These studies have shown that the effectiveness of docking in virtual screening is highly variable due to a large number of possible confounding factors. Another class of method that has shown promise in virtual screening is the shape-based, ligand-centric approach. Several direct comparisons of docking with the shape-based tool {ROCS} have been conducted using data sets from some of these recent docking publications. The results show that a shape-based, ligand-centric approach is more consistent than, and often superior to, the protein-centric approach taken by docking.},

Different experimental and computational methods have been applied to better understanding these intermolecular interactions. Here we report a method based on geometric deep learning that is capable of predicting the binding conformations of ligands to protein targets. The model learns a statistical potential based on the distance likelihood, which is tailor-made for each ligand–target pair. This potential can be coupled with global optimization algorithms to reproduce the experimental binding conformations of ligands. We show that the potential based on distance likelihood, described here, performs similarly or better than well-established scoring functions for docking and screening tasks. Overall, this method represents an example of how artificial intelligence can be used to improve structure-based drug design. Predicting binding of ligands to molecular targets is a key task in the development of new drugs.
